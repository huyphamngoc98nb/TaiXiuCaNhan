# In-app updates

## Overview

Android in-app updates use this flow:

```text
latest.json
→ compare latest.versionCode with the installed versionCode
→ show AppUpdateDialog
→ check Install unknown apps permission
→ stream the APK into app cache through AppUpdatePlugin
→ verify SHA-256
→ verify APK package, version, and optional signing certificate pin
→ create a FileProvider content URI
→ open the Android installer
```

The browser never downloads the APK. On non-Android platforms the check returns `unsupported_platform`, and Settings explains that APK updates are Android-only.

During an Android download, the native plugin emits `appUpdateDownloadProgress`. The dialog shows percentage progress when the server provides a content length; otherwise it shows an indeterminate bar and the downloaded byte count. Native listeners are removed after success, failure, or component unmount.

## `latest.json` contract

```json
{
  "platform": "android",
  "versionName": "0.1.21",
  "versionCode": 121,
  "minSupportedVersionCode": 100,
  "mandatory": false,
  "apkUrl": "https://github.com/example/TaiChinhCaNhan/releases/download/v0.1.21/TaiChinhCaNhan-v0.1.21.apk",
  "sha256": "64-character SHA-256 digest",
  "releaseDate": "2026-06-29",
  "releaseNotes": ["Fix backup flow"]
}
```

Required fields are `platform`, `versionName`, `versionCode`, `apkUrl`, and `sha256`. `platform` must be `android`; `versionCode` must be a positive integer. Missing `mandatory` and `releaseNotes` values normalize to `false` and `[]`.

## Update dialog behavior

When the app detects a newer Android version, it displays a blocking update dialog. The dialog always shows the new version and a release-notes list from `latest.json`; when `releaseNotes` is missing, empty, or contains only blank entries, it shows a localized fallback note.

Optional updates require an explicit choice between `Cập nhật` and `Bỏ qua phiên bản này`. Skipping stores that `versionCode`, closes the dialog, and prevents the automatic check from showing the same optional version again. A manual check from Settings ignores the stored skipped version.

Mandatory updates show only `Cập nhật`. For both optional and mandatory updates, clicking outside the dialog, pressing Escape, or pressing Android Back does not close the dialog or navigate away, and keyboard focus remains inside the dialog.

## Release notes

Each `latest.json` should include a `releaseNotes` array. Keep each entry short and user-facing. The field remains optional so older manifests continue to parse; the dialog supplies the fallback text when no usable entries are present.

When `minSupportedVersionCode` is greater than the installed version code, the frontend treats the update as mandatory.

## Environment and configuration

The metadata endpoint defaults to:

```text
https://huyphamngoc98nb.github.io/TaiChinhCaNhan/latest.json
```

Override it at build time when needed:

```dotenv
VITE_ANDROID_LATEST_JSON_URL=<url-to-latest.json>
```

See `.env.example` for optional current-version compatibility fallbacks. Normal Android builds read the installed version through `AppUpdatePlugin.getCurrentVersion()`.

## Release process

1. Update `version.config.json` with a higher native version code and matching version name.
2. Build and sign the release APK.
3. Generate release metadata:

   ```bash
   npm run generate:android-release-metadata
   ```

4. Verify the generated `latest.json` points to the uploaded APK asset and contains the APK's exact SHA-256 digest.
5. Publish `latest.json` to the configured static metadata URL.

See [android-release.md](./android-release.md) for signing, tagging, and GitHub release details.

## Error and retry behavior

Native error codes are mapped to localized messages. Download, verification, permission, FileProvider, and installer failures leave the dialog open with a `Thử lại` button. Before a new download, a missing “Install unknown apps” permission opens Android Settings and rejects the attempt without downloading. After granting permission, return to the app and retry manually; retries never loop automatically.

If the release APK already exists in private app cache, the native plugin verifies its SHA-256 and APK identity before reusing it. Invalid cached files are deleted. A valid cached APK is opened through FileProvider after permission is granted, so returning through the app lock flow does not force the same release to download again.

The APK is deliberately retained after installer handoff because Android may still be reading the FileProvider URI. On later app startups and update attempts, files older than 24 hours are removed from `cache/app-update/`. This cleanup is best-effort, preserves the current target filename, and never blocks update checks.

## Manual QA checklist

- App starts normally when update check fails.
- No dialog appears when `latest.versionCode <= current.versionCode`.
- Dialog appears when `latest.versionCode > current.versionCode`.
- Release notes are displayed when present.
- A fallback release note is displayed when `releaseNotes` is missing or empty.
- Clicking outside the dialog does not close it.
- Escape does not close the dialog in web/development builds.
- Android Back does not close the dialog, navigate away, or exit the app.
- Optional update requires either `Cập nhật` or `Bỏ qua phiên bản này`.
- Skipping closes an optional update and suppresses the same version during automatic checks.
- Mandatory update hides `Bỏ qua phiên bản này` and cannot be bypassed.
- Clicking “Cập nhật” checks install permission before starting a new native APK download.
- Progress updates during download.
- Unknown content length shows indeterminate progress and downloaded bytes.
- Repeated taps do not start duplicate downloads.
- Native progress listeners are removed after success, error, and unmount.
- SHA-256 mismatch shows an error, deletes the cached APK, and does not open the installer.
- Valid SHA-256 opens the Android installer through a `content://` FileProvider URI.
- Missing “Install unknown apps” permission opens Android settings, shows the permission message, and does not start a new download.
- After permission is granted, the user can retry the update manually.
- A valid cached APK is reverified and reused without another download.
- An invalid cached APK is deleted and downloaded fresh only when permission is granted.
- Returning through app lock after Android Settings does not force a valid cached APK to download again.
- Installer handoff does not immediately delete the APK backing its FileProvider URI.
- A later app startup deletes unrelated APK files older than 24 hours.
- Cleanup keeps the active target APK and never deletes outside `cache/app-update/`.
- Cleanup failure is logged but does not block startup or update checks.
- Failed downloads show “Thử lại” without automatically looping.
- Canceling the installer does not crash the app.
- After installing the new APK, the same update no longer appears.
- Settings → “Kiểm tra cập nhật” opens the same dialog when an update exists.
- Settings shows “Bạn đang dùng phiên bản mới nhất” when no update exists.
- Settings explains that APK updates are Android-only on unsupported platforms.
