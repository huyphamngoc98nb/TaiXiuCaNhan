# Security Notes

## Local SQLite Encryption

The app opens native SQLite databases with SQLCipher enabled. The decision is explicit in
`src/core/db/sqlite/encryption.ts` and is used by `initDatabaseConnection`.

The app must authenticate the user before opening the database connection. `AppBootstrap` renders
`AppUnlock` first, then initializes SQLite only after `AuthService.unlockWithPin()` succeeds.

### Current State

- Native Android/iOS: SQLCipher is enabled through `@capacitor-community/sqlite`.
- Web: `jeep-sqlite` stores data in IndexedDB and does not support opening encrypted databases in
  the same way as native.
- Manual backup export: encryption is enabled by default and uses a user-provided password with
  PBKDF2-SHA-256 and AES-GCM. AES-GCM detects a wrong password or a modified backup file.
- Automatic backup export can also be encrypted on native Android. The auto-backup password is
  stored through the app's secure secret store, not in SQLite settings.
- SQLCipher protects the local database file only. Encrypted backup export separately protects the
  exported file.
- Plaintext manual exports remain available for compatibility. Plaintext automatic backups are also
  possible when auto-backup encryption is disabled. Anyone with access to plaintext files can read
  their contents.
- Automatic backup retention manages only local metadata for automatic backup files recorded by the
  app. It preserves each backup file's encrypted/plaintext state and only deletes old auto backups.
- Retention does not scan the whole Downloads folder and does not delete files outside recorded
  automatic-backup metadata.

### Secret Handling

- The encryption passphrase is never hardcoded.
- The user-entered PIN is passed to `setEncryptionSecret()` on first native setup.
- Existing installs use `checkEncryptionSecret()` before the DB is opened.
- First launch includes a two-step setup and confirm PIN flow. The PIN must contain at least six
  digits.
- Users can change the native PIN. The app verifies the current PIN, calls the SQLite plugin's
  `changeEncryptionSecret()` rekey API, reopens the database connection, and disables biometric
  unlock until it is enabled again.
- The SQLite plugin stores the secret in native secure storage. On Android this is backed by
  encrypted preferences / Keystore-backed primitives inside the plugin; on iOS it uses Keychain
  configuration from Capacitor SQLite.
- The app does not persist the PIN in app code or local storage.
- Backup passwords are not stored in `app_settings` or elsewhere by the app. Losing a backup
  password makes that encrypted backup unrecoverable.
- The automatic-backup password is stored under `auto_backup_password` in the native secure secret
  store. It is never stored in `app_settings`, SQLite rows, localStorage, sessionStorage, or
  IndexedDB, and it is never included in backup payloads.
- On Web, the secure secret store intentionally does not persist secrets. Encrypted automatic backup
  is therefore unavailable on Web unless a native secure-storage equivalent is added.
- If auto-backup encryption is enabled but the secure secret is missing, the app does not save a
  plaintext fallback and does not update `auto_backup_last_run_at`.

### PIN Recovery And Local Reset

- A forgotten PIN cannot be viewed, recovered, or bypassed.
- The unlock screen and Security settings offer an explicit local reset flow. Reset requires an
  acknowledgement checkbox and typing `RESET`.
- Reset closes the SQLite connection, deletes the local database, clears the native encryption
  secret, and disables biometric unlock. It only reports success when every required step succeeds.
- Exported backup files are outside app-local database storage and are not deleted by reset.
- Losing the PIN without a usable backup can permanently lose access to encrypted local data.
- On Web, data is stored through IndexedDB/jeep-sqlite without native SQLCipher PIN protection.

### Remaining Security Work

1. Test fresh install, app upgrade from unencrypted DB, encrypted/plaintext restore, biometric failure, local reset, auto-backup encryption, and secret rotation on real devices.
2. Add an iOS native secure-secret-store implementation before enabling encrypted automatic backup on iOS.

## Android Internet Permission And App Updates

The app is local-first: core financial data stays in the local SQLite database. The Android
`INTERNET` permission is used only to check the update `latest.json` file and to download an APK
after the user confirms an update. The app does not automatically upload wallets, transactions,
backups, receipt images, or error logs.

Automatic update checks are enabled by default and can be disabled in **Settings**. Manual update
checks remain available when automatic checks are off.

Android update traffic is protected by these controls:

- Update manifest and APK URLs must use HTTPS and match their configured domain allowlists;
  Android cleartext traffic is disabled.
- The downloaded file must match the SHA-256 value in the update manifest.
- Before opening the installer, the APK package name must match this app and its version code must
  be newer than the installed version.
- Signing-certificate fingerprint verification is enforced only when a real release fingerprint is
  configured as `APP_UPDATE_SIGNING_CERT_SHA256`. If it is missing or blank, certificate pinning is
  skipped; no placeholder fingerprint is used.
- Android still shows its installer confirmation before installation.
